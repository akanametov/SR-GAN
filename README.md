Super-Resolution GAN
======================

:star: Star this project on GitHub â€” it helps!

[Super-Resolution GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802) is one of the best examples in GAN's application. It allows
to imporove the quality of input low-resolution image. As **Generator** this GAN uses
**SRResNet** (Super-Resolution Residual Network). In order to provide better quality of
the output image the network is trained on three different loss functions.

## Evaluation

This document is for the latest Aimeos TYPO3 **20.10 release and later**.

- LTS release: 20.10 (TYPO3 9/10 LTS)
- Beta release: 2021.01 (TYPO3 9/10 LTS)

## Training

### Database

The Super-Resolution GAN was trained on **STL10** dataset from `torchvision.dataset`.

### WarmUp of Generator

Before to train both **Generator** and **Discriminator** we should pretrain our **Ganarator** on
dataset with **Pixel-wise Loss** function.

See [Super-Resolution [GAN WarmUp]](https://github.com/akanametov/SuperResolution/tree/main/demo) for **Generator**'s warmup.

### Training with Discriminator

After **Generator** warmup we train booth **Generator** and **Discriminator** with their loss functions.
The **Generator loss** consists of **Adverserial loss**(BCE loss between *fake prediction and target*),
**Model Based loss**(feature based MSE loss between *fake and real images*) and **Pixel-wise loss**(MSE loss between *fake and real images*).
