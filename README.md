======================

:star: Star this project on GitHub â€” it helps!

[Super-Resolution GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802) is one of the best examples in GAN's application. It allows
to imporove the quality of input low-resolution image. As **Generator** this GAN uses
**SRResNet** (Super-Resolution Residual Network). In order to provide better quality of
the output image the network is trained on three different loss functions.
